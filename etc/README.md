Sample data was provided by Debora Mroczek (deboramroczek@gmail.com) and is also available at

  * https://cloud.musesframework.io/s/obY7pCAPbg4FckN

Note that dat files were combined into a single (compressed) CSV via

```
./convert
```

---

Each file contains 3 columns, the first 2 are the baryon chemical potential (mu_B) and temperature and the third is the corresponding thermodynamic quantity on the name of the file.

  * mu_B ranges from 0 to 450 MeV
  * T ranges from 30 to 800 MeV

All thermodynamic quantities are dimensionless (i.e. P and energy density are divided by T^4, entropy and baryon density, T^3).
