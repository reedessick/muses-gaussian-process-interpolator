A sandbox to test interpolation of EoS tables from stellarcollapse.org with the goal of producing estimates for the temperature on a regularly spaced grid of (number density, energy density, electron fraction).

The basic script can be run via

```
./sc-eos-test ../../etc/stellarcollapse-eos/LS180_234r_136t_50y_analmu_20091212_SVNr26.h5
```
